  <h1>Welcome to Honest AB!</h1>
  <p>
    Honest AB is a machine learning based A/B testing service that provides insights on your site's visitors and explains like you're a human. Provide AB with some background on your site's users and how they react to your A/B tests and AB can provide statistically significant estimates on the winning test variant as well as trends indicating what causes users to click. For example, imagine you are a popular blogging platform testing out a pared down version of your online post editor. You hypothesise that removing less frequently used features will improve retention of new customers. You run the test and see a lift in overall success, but what you don't realize is that your premium users - your revenue source - are not happy about the change since many are power users who enjoyed the wealth of features in your editor. That's where AB insights come in. Honest AB will automatically find the features that contribute most to a user's decision to click and distill its findings into easily understandable trends.
